    # data_display_panel
Code and other assets used for collecting and displaying system data.

This repository contains two systems for the server and client devices.
At present, each client system will host an API endpoint that the server can search for and request information from.
Not best practice, this is for me to learn how to use APIs. This will be changed in future.
